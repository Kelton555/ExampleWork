# ExampleWork
A showcase of some of my previous school work.

### MultiCalculator.cpp (2/26/2024, 3/12/2024)
The earliest program I've included here, created for my midterm project of an introductory programming course. The midterm was meant to assess our ability to use math functions, operators, and control flow.

### WordAssociation.cpp (4/20/2024 - 4/30/2024)
Created as my final project for the same introductory programming course. The final project was meant to assess our ability to save and load data from a file, control flow, loops, user input validation, functions, and 2D arrays/vectors.

### GameCharacter\[.java\] (10/1/2024 - 10/2/2024)
Created as the second programming project in an introductory Java class. Meant to assess skills in basic class design, objects, methods, and control structures.

### GameSkillCalculator.cpp (10/16/2024)
Created as my midterm project for a C++ programming course. The midterm project was meant to assess our ability to use structs/enums and cstrings and our ability to sort and search arrays alongside the general assessments listed above (functions, valid input, variables, etc.).
