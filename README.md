# ExampleWork
A showcase of some of my previous school work.

### MultiCalculator.cpp (2/26/2024, 3/12/2024)
The earliest program I've included here, created for my midterm project of an introductory programming course. The midterm was meant to assess our ability to use math functions, operators, and control flow.

### WordAssociation.cpp (4/20/2024 - 4/30/2024)
Created as my final project for the same introductory programming course. The final project was meant to assess our ability to save and load data from a file, control flow, loops, user input validation, functions, and 2D arrays/vectors.

### GameCharacter\[.java\] (10/1/2024 - 10/2/2024)
Created as the second programming project in an introductory Java class. Meant to assess skills in basic class design, objects, methods, and control structures.

### GameSkillCalculator.cpp (10/16/2024)
Created as my midterm project for a C++ programming course. The midterm project was meant to assess our ability to use structs/enums and cstrings and our ability to sort and search arrays alongside the general assessments listed above (functions, valid input, variables, etc.).

### PassphraseGenerator\[.java\] (11/23/2024 - 11/29/2024)
Created as the fourth programming project in an introductory Java class. Meant to assess skills in file input, exceptions, and reusable class design. Some decisions were made to follow extremely specific rubric criteria, such as using both a hashset and a hashmap even though the hashmap implicitly contains the data in the hashset.

### ChanceCalculator\[.cpp\] (11/28/2024 - 12/10/2024)
Created as my final project for a C++ programming course. It was meant to assess our ability to utilize various things within C++ to implement a program of our devising. Some of these assessed 'things' included math operations and functions, classes specified with .h files, overloaded functions (in classes), inheritence or templates, and binary input and output.

### ShapeDrawingProgram (~April 2025)
Created as the 7th project in a Java course. Allows the user to draw in a window using various shapes, and to save their work to a file. Files consist of the exact shape objects drawn to the screen and can be loaded into the program.

### TicTacToe (~April 2025)
Created as my final project for an ASP.NET course. Functional tic tac toe game using serverside logic with clientside storage.
